# Reference Implementation for SPM distribution of ZcashLightClientKit

**N.B** 

- The namings of this are a little confusing, this is very much still reference / proof of concept, but not far off distributable.
- The `Package.swift` refers to `ZCashLC.xcframework` as binaryTarget, and the rest are the sources from ZcashLightClientKit.
- `ZCashLC.xcframework` is an XCFramework construction of the `librustzcashlc.[a,h]`
- `ZCashLC.xcframework` is created from the cargo build from `ZcashLightClientKit` by building static libraries for all the architectures we want (in this case arm64-ios, arm64-ios-sim and x86_64 sim) and `lipo`-ing and `xcodebuild create-xcframework`-ing

This _should_ function for a consumer of the SDK (integrated via spm) in exactly the same way as the current cocoapods integration does. As a bonus, for contributors we now have a completely auto generated `xcodeproject` when working on this as well... Try for yourself üòÅ, just double-click the `Package.swift` to open it in Xcode.
